Solar Quiet and Disturbance Algorithm Usage
===========================================

The Solar Quiet and Disturbance Algorithm calculates `Solar Variation`,
`Solar Quiet` and `Disturbance` from raw Geomagnetic data.


> Note: this library internally represents data gaps as NaN, and factories
> convert to this where possible.
